# PSIA Project Specification

## Introduction
This project will require a hands-on infrastructure environment that will allow you to validate the skills and knowledge you have learned so far in this course. It corresponds to 50% of the course's final grade.

The Project is sized to be developed by a team of three students. The objective, although simple, corresponds to a **realistic** example on how to deploy and provision a tiered (frontend, backend) **Microservices-based** application with AI components on a Public Cloud provider, such as **Google Cloud Platform** (GCP) or **Amazon Web Services** (AWS). The project entails the use of automation tools such as **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Pulumi**, as well as the instrumentation of applications, services and infrastructure components to monitor and log application behavior using tools such as **Prometheus**, **Fluentd**, **Grafana**, etc. The infrastructure will be orchestrated with **Kubernetes**.

The architecture of the base solution should consist of the following main services:

- **Frontend**: the entry point (ingress) that exposes an HTTP server (serving the Web site);
- **Backend services**: provide the desired application domain logic;
- **ObjectStore/Database**: data storage. Note that following microservices best practices, each microservice must have its own dedicated database instance (i.e., a database should only be accessed by a single microservice);
- **Inference Engine**: model inference engine used by backend services;
- **Monitoring Server**: provides insight over the system.

The following figure depicts a typical application architecture.

The solution should correspond to a simple but functional system. It is up to each team to decide how and where (e.g., in which cloud provider) to implement and deploy the solution. The solution should be easily reproducible, i.e., each team must include deployment instructions in the respective project report, so that anyone following those instructions is able to deploy the system (avoiding, as much as possible, vendor lock-in situations). The project implementation can be divided into two main stages:

- Stage I: a base solution consisting of a functional system without advanced features;
- Stage II: an enhanced solution with the addition of components or deployments methods to provide advanced features.

## Base Solution

The Base solution has a **weight of 70%** on the evaluation of the implemented project and can be achieved following the steps described below. The recommended implementation strategy involves the following steps:

**Step 1**: Building a simple local application using a Microservices-based architecture. See below the specification of the target application that should be developed;

**Step 2**: Package and deploying the required infrastructure locally as containers, using Docker Compose for example;

**Step 3**: Deploying the infrastructure on a Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes cluster should be launched entirely using IaC tools. The application should also be deployed using IaC tools. Only self-hosted Kubernetes deployments are allowed, solutions such as Google Kubernetes Engine are forbidden;

**Step 4**: Deploying operations tooling that will allow basic traceability and performance monitoring of the solution. For that, you will need to have configured the application (and other resources) to expose some metrics in order to show their health and status, and then deploy a monitoring server using, for example Prometheus, and create a Dashboard (e.g., using Grafana) to display the metrics in real-time.

You have to update the project's code repository regularly as this will help us understand the distribution of work among the team members and the various stages of development. Each team member must update their group's repository as they complete the various tasks assigned to them. Failure to do so may lead to grading penalties.

## Advanced Components or Deployments Methods

The advanced components for the project either provide additional features or correspond to different deployment methods. The implementation of these features has a **weight of 30%** on the evaluation of the project. The maximum grade of the project can be reached by implementing **one** the following options in your project:

- Create and run a complete **Continuous Integration** (CI) / **Continuous Deployment** (CD) pipeline for your application, using for example GitLab CI and ArgoCD, in order to automatically test, package and deploy the application on every commit;
- Create a **DevSecOps** pipeline by extending a basic CI pipeline to include automated security analysis. This should include Static Application Security Testing (SAST), container image scanning, and dependency vulnerability checks that run automatically on every commit;
- Deploy the developed application with **persistent state** using self-hosted storage and or databases. With this feature, you should be able to shutdown the entire infrastructure (i.e. shutdown all VMs) and later turn it back on without loosing any application state;
- Deploy the application with **automatic scaling**, meaning that you should automatically scale depending on the load being received by the application. Note that you should consider both vertical and horizontal scaling. If the report, you should ellaborate on the tradeoffs inherent to each type of scaling and why you converged on your solution;

## Target Application Domain

For this year's project, the application is an **AI-powered Movie Recommendation Hub**. The goal is that users can register in the system, login, and create personalized profiles detailing their interests. Users can then interact with the system by asking the platform's AI for movie recommendations that match their profile and preferences.

The developed platform should allow users to browse and view the profiles of other users to discover new interests. The AI component (inference engine) should also be actively used in the backend to process user requests and generate these personalized recommendations. Additionally, the system should feature a background agent that proactively produces and caches movie recommendations based on user profiles, so that users are immediately greeted with fresh recommendations upon logging in.

The project is open-ended, and we do not specify the exact features the application should have, as long as it successfully integrates the microservices, manages user state, and queries the AI inference engine without crashing.

The application should expose a web interface that could be used from a normal browser. Focus on functionality rather than aesthetics.

## Deliverables and deadline

After finalizing your project, you need to prepare documentation on it (deliverables) and submit it for evaluation. There is only one submission for each group, produced collaboratively, and needs to be submitted by just one member of the group.

**The deadline for this submission is Monday, October 19th, 2026, by 23h59. Project discussions will be held on Friday 23rd.** The discussion schedule will be announced shortly after the project deadline.

The deliverables to submit (to the specified platform) are the following:

- **Fenix**: a Report describing the Project, including the architecture of the solution, the components, the tools used for the deployment;
- **Gitlab**: the last commit of the project pushed to the group Git repository, `https://gitlab.rnl.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/psia/groups26/gN`, where `N` represents your group number;
- **Youtube**: a short video showing the deployments steps of the solution until being running in production and demonstrating its behavior.

### Project Report

The Report must be a PDF file submitted to **Fenix**. The name of the file **must** be `project-gN.pdf`, where `N` represents your group number. The report's format is flexible and to your liking, although the following guidelines should be taken into account:

- The number and name of each active member of the group should be included (this is to double check the composition of the groups, since sometimes there are changes that are not reflected in Fenix);
- The report is written in English;
- The link to the video must be provided in the beginning (e.g., in the Introduction);
- The report should include figures or diagrams, for example the Architecture of the solution, which can be produced using for example the Diagrams.net tool;
- The content of the report should include: i) an Introduction explaining the context of the project, ii) the System Design and Architecture corresponding to the base system, iii) Advanced Components or Deployment Methods correspondoing to your advanced features, and iv) an Evaluation section that includes a throughput and latency study of the system as the number of clients generating requests increases;
- The report should be limited to 5 pages using Times New Roman, Arial or similar, at least font size 10, margin sizes (2.0 cm side and 1.5 cm top and bottom), and single line spacing.

If you are looking for a report template, [LNCS](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

### Source code

The source code of the project should be submitted to the team repository presented above and contain all files and directories necessary for reproducing the experiment, including instructional READMEs, screenshots and diagrams illustrating the architecture, the steps, the procedures, and application usage (including screenshots of the Web UI), etc.

A `README.md` in the root directory should contain:

- a brief description of the application and of the solution and its components;
- instructions for installing and configuring the entire system so that it can be setup in fully operational conditions.

### Video

The video can be structured in any way. It can be an interactive tour, a demo, a slideshow with voice overlay, etc. It constitutes an opportunity to better explain how the application was developed, how it is implemented, the main hurdles encountered, and above all to demonstrate that it works! If you implemented any advanced feature, you should show this feature working during your video demonstration.

The requirements for the video are:

- should be done in collaboration by all the members, not just one:
- should be released on **YouTube**;
- should be public (or unlisted, if students are not comfortable with showing it to the world);
- the link to the video **must** be provided in the beginning of the Project Report; (e.g., in the Introduction);
- the duration should not exceed 10 minutes;
- The resolution should be at least HD-720p (1280x720);
- Its quality can be assessed by the degree to which the application, its architecture, implementation, configuration, etc., the viewer is able to understand the work done and by how successfully it demonstrates that the application actually works.

## Examples of open-source applications

The following examples are given as inspiration material. Some of these examples are used as demonstrators or sandboxes for the technologies and/or tools used for the build and deployment of microservice-based applications, either locally and on-premises (in a development computer) or on different cloud providers.

These open-source applications should be used as a source of inspiration. **You should build your own application and not use these applications directly.**

Also, you are not allowed to just "reproduce" ipsis-verbis in your project the procedures there exemplified, as it would constitute an act of plagiarism, and also because in most cases those procedures are not appropriate, may not be applicable in this project, or may even be deprecated (due to the normal and very fast evolution of the Tools and Services being used in those examples).

### Build a Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins and Kubernetes

# FAQ

**Do I need to use an ML model in the project? Which model should be used?**

Students need to use AI model(s) to fulfil two use cases in the project: a) users may request new recommendations, potentially with specific requests (e.g., a horror movie from the 80s); b) the platform should prepare recommendations for users such that when users log in, those recommendations can be presented. Students should find a model and explore how to use it. You can use LLMs, models specialized for recommendation, or even a combination. Do not train or fine-tune models for this course; instead, you should utilize models published in public repositories (e.g., Hugging Face) and use them. While we won't evaluate the model performance, we expect the model to provide minimally acceptable recommendations such that the project works. The model decision and how to use the model should be described in your final report.
